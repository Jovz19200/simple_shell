# simple_shell
In this project,
Me and my colleague Isaac
will work out a simple shell
with almost all functionalities of normal shell.
A shell is a special user program that provides an interface to the user to use OS services.
shell accepts human readable commands and converts them into something kernel can understand and interpret.
